## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Import Dataset
```{r}
data <- read.csv("climate_change_impact_on_agriculture_2024.csv")
```

### Preparation and cleaning the data

```{r}
# mutate continent columns

country_to_continent <- data.frame(
  Country = c("Argentina", "Australia", "Brazil","Canada","China","France",
              "India","Nigeria", "Russia","USA"),
  Continent = c("South America", "Oceania", "South America", 
                "North America", "East Asia", "Europe", 
                "South Asia", "Africa","Eurasia","North America")
)

data_with_continent <- data %>%
  left_join(country_to_continent, by = "Country") 

data <- data_with_continent %>%
  select(Year, Country, Continent, Region, everything())

```

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Check if the required variables are available in the dataset
if (!all(c("Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA", "Soil_Health_Index") %in% colnames(data))) {
  stop("Variables 'yield' and 'soil_health_index' are missing in the dataset.")
}

# Model: Yield as a function of Soil Health Index
model_Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA_Soil_Health_Index <- lm(Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA ~ Soil_Health_Index, data = data)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA_Soil_Health_Index)

```
```{r}
# Rename 'Soil_Health_Index' to 'Soil_Health'
data <- data %>%
  rename(Soil_Health = Soil_Health_Index)

```

```{r}
sampled_data_by_country <- data %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  sample_frac(0.1) %>%  
  ungroup()  


ggplot(sampled_data_by_country, aes(x = Soil_Health, y = Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.5, aes(color = Country)) +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +  
  labs(
    title = "Crop Yield vs Soil Health by Country (Sampled)",
    x = "Soil Health Index",
    y = "Crop Yield (MT/HA)"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ Country, scales = "free") 
```

```{r}
# Perform linear regression by country and extract slope and intercept
library(dplyr)

country_slopes <- data %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarize(
    slope = coef(lm(Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA ~ Soil_Health, data = cur_data()))[2],
    intercept = coef(lm(Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA ~ Soil_Health, data = cur_data()))[1]
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(slope))  # Sort by slope in descending order

# Print the results
print(country_slopes)

```

###Modeling 4

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA, y = Economic_Impact_Million_USD)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7, color = "blue") +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +  
  labs(
    title = "Economic Impact vs Crop Yield by Country",
    x = "Crop Yield (MT/HA)",
    y = "Economic Impact (Million USD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ Country, scales = "free")  
```

```{r}
# Linear Regression by Country and Extracting Slopes
library(dplyr)

# Perform linear regression for each country and extract slope coefficients
country_slopes <- data %>%

  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Slope))  # Sort by slope in descending order

# Display the countries with the highest and lowest slopes
print(country_slopes)
```

```{r}
ggplot(country_slopes, aes(x = Country, y = Slope, color = Slope)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Slope, 2)), vjust = -1, size = 3) +  # Display slope values
  labs(
    title = "Country-wise Crop Yield Efficiency (Slope)",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Slope (Efficiency)"
  ) +
