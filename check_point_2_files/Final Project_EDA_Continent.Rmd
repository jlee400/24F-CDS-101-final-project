## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Import Dataset
```{r}
data <- read.csv("climate_change_impact_on_agriculture_2024.csv")
```

### Preparation and cleaning the data

```{r}
# mutate continent columns

country_to_continent <- data.frame(
  Country = c("Argentina", "Australia", "Brazil","Canada","China","France",
              "India","Nigeria", "Russia","USA"),
  Continent = c("South America", "Oceania", "South America",

data <- data_with_continent %>%
  select(Year, Country, Continent, Region, everything())

# Continent

# 1) avg_temp and continent

Box plot for Average Temperature by Continent

```{r}
anova_results <- aov(Average_Temperature_C ~ Continent, data = data)
summary(anova_results)
```

p-value

```{r}
p_value <- summary(anova_results)[[1]]["Pr(>F)"]
```

Box plot 

```{r}
ggplot(data) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Continent, Average_Temperature_C, fill = Continent)) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Temperature by Continent",
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Average Temperature (°C)"
  )
```

Purpose:

   - The graph shows the distribution of average temperatures for various continents. It helps compare the central tendencies, variability, and overall spread of temperatures across continents.

Hypothesis:

   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in average temperature across continents.


   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in average temperature across continents

Analysis:

   - East Asia and South Asia have slightly higher medians compared to others, indicating generally warmer climates in these regions.
   
   - **Africa**, **South America**, and **South Asia** have larger IQRs, meaning their average temperatures vary more within the continent. **Europe** has the smallest IQR, indicating less variability in temperatures across the continent.

   - South Asia shows a slightly longer lower whisker, potentially indicating a slight negative skew with some regions experiencing cooler temperatures compared to the majority.
   
   - Most continents share a similar temperature range, roughly between 0°C and 30°C. **South Asia** and **South America** have slightly broader ranges, indicating greater diversity in climate. **Oceania** and **North America** show more consistent distributions around the mid-range temperatures.

   - **Africa** and **South Asia** stand out for their broader variability, possibly reflecting diverse climate zones within these continents. The general clustering of median temperatures in the **10–20°C range** suggests a moderate climate across many regions, except for specific tropical or extreme climates.




# 2) Year vs CO2 emissions

Bar plot for CO2 Emissions by Year

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = CO2_Emissions_MT, fill = Continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ Continent) +
  labs(title = "CO₂ Emissions by Year (Separated by Content)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "CO₂ Emissions (Million Tons)",
       fill = "Continent"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Graph Representation:
   - This is a faceted bar plot showing CO₂ emissions (in million tons) over time (years) for different continents. Each facet (subplot) represents a continent, and the bars show how emissions vary across years within that continent. The color coding differentiates the continents, making it easier to identify which plot belongs to which continent.

Hypotheses:

   - Null Hypothesis (H0): CO₂ emissions have not significantly changed over 
the years.

   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): CO₂ emissions have significantly changed over the years.

Analysis:

   - **North America**: Generally higher emissions compared to other continents, but a possible stabilization or slight decline in recent years.
   
   - **South Asia**: Significant growth in emissions over the years, indicating rapid industrialization and development.

   - **Africa & Oceania**: Lower overall emissions, with relatively stable trends over time.

   - **Europe**: A slight decline in emissions, possibly due to cleaner energy policies and technological advancements.

   - **South America**: Relatively stable emissions, with moderate year-to-year fluctuations.

   - **East Asia**: Moderate to high emissions, showing gradual growth.




# 3) Extreme weather by year

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Extreme_Weather_Events, fill = Continent)) +
  geom_bar(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black", alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ Continent) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Extreme Weather Events by Continent",
    x = "Number of Occurrences",
    y = "Frequency",
    fill = "Continent"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Hypotheses:

   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the frequency 
of extreme weather events across continents over the years; any observed differences are due to random chance.

   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in the frequency of extreme weather events across continents over the years.

Analysis:

   - **North America**: Shows a higher frequency of extreme weather events in 
the upper range, suggesting it might experience more severe or frequent events compared to other continents. Also, there’s a noticeable concentration of higher frequency events in the upper bins, indicating potential hotspots or clusters of severe events.

   - **South America and Africa**: Display relatively balanced distributions, with  no significant spikes in event frequency. This indicates a consistent pattern of extreme weather events across different ranges.

   - **Oceania and Europe**: Have lower frequency distributions overall compared to continents like North America, suggesting they might experience fewer extreme weather events.

   - **South Asia**: Exhibits a wider spread of extreme weather events, indicating varying severity or frequency in this region.




# 4) Year vs precipitation

Histogram for extreme weather by year in continent

```{r}
precipitation_model <- aov(Total_Precipitation_mm ~ Continent * Year, data = data) 
summary(precipitation_model)
p_value <- summary(precipitation_model)[[1]]["Pr(>F)"]
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Precipitation_mm, fill = Continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Continent) +
   labs(
      title = "Annual Precipitation by Year and Continent", 
      x = "Year", 
      y = "Average Precipitation (mm)",
      fill = "Continent"
   ) +
 theme_minimal()
```

Hypotheses:

   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in average annual precipitation across continents over the years; any observed differences are due to random variation.

   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in average annual precipitation across continents over the years.

Analysis:

   - **Africa**: Precipitation levels appear relatively stable with minor fluctuations over time.

   - **East Asia and Eurasia**: These continents show a similar trend of stable precipitation with no noticeable spikes or drops.

   - **Europe**: Precipitation seems consistent, but a closer look may reveal slight yearly variations compared to other continents.

   - **North America and Oceania**: Both regions maintain fairly consistent precipitation levels, with no significant changes year over year.

   - **South America and South Asia**: South Asia has relatively stable precipitation. South America shows similar stability, but the overall precipitation levels are slightly higher than some other regions.
